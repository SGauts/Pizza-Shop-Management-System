# Pizza-Shop-Management-System
Our PSMS will be equipped with a user-friendly Input screen, having functionality ranging from ordering a Pizza to edit profile and to change/edit employee details based on the designation of the user. For this System there will be a System Administrator, Shop Manager, Shop Cashiers and Customers entering in the shop. System Administrator will be having full view and edit rights over other employees whereas the Manager will be having some restricted rights over the Cashier. Cashier on the other hand will be having rights only on his account. All of the employees will be provided with a unique ID and a secured password to enter the system. The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Customer and Employees, Order Status, and Redeem Points. It tracks all the details about the Sales, Menu, Orders, Employees and Customer.
